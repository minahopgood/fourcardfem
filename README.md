## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really struggled with placing the desktop view of the cards as I haven't used Flexbox like this before, so it was quite the challenge! I wasn't able to figure out how to change the order of Karma and Calculator without messing up the whole layout, so any suggestions on this would be amazing.

I did learn a little bit more about linear backgrounds in order to create the coloured lines at the top of the cards.

### Continued development

As I have found in the past, I need to work more with Flexbox to get used to each of the options it contains, but everytime I complete a FEM challenge I feel more equipped to deal with it.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - This helped me to learn more about linear backgrounds to add the strip of colour to the div's.
- [Thomas Sanka - Youtube](https://youtu.be/29SSTkQtWcg?si=J3GhN6toptPNhwut) - I couldn't figure out how to use flex to change the layout, so I followed this tutorial for guidance on setting it up.
